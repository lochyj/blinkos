# blinkos

BlinkOS is a hobby operating system made for fun and education. Started in late 2022, BlinkOS was originally created from a mash of tutorials and OSDev wiki snippets. BlinkOS is now mostly custom made.

BlinkOS is currently in a very early stage of development, and probably wont be ready for any sort of use for a long time (maybe never).
